The toolkit is developed using miscrosoft visual C++ 2017. The realsed version is built with Windows10 X64 settings.
You may need to install the Visual C++ 2017 redistributable (x64) pakage. It can be downloaded from:

https://download.microsoft.com/download/B/7/A/B7A6D5AB-2606-4942-BE19-996D105376A4/vc_redist.x64.exe

It can be used for scale-sets based analysis of remote sensing images.

It can produced scale-sets hierarchy with very large images (ie. 20000*20000 pixels), however, 
restricted by some cooperate agreements, the acdemic software outputs segmentation and 
classification results no larger than 5000*5000 pixles.

An simple illustration is provided in the user guide book.
